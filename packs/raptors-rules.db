When creating your character you may optionally choose to give yourself, at most, one Anti-Feat in exchange for getting one Feat or Ability Score Increase of your choosing. These Anti-Feats are here purely to give you more options and provide additional roleplay potential, but I cannot promise that they are balanced, so you are free to suggest tweaks if you think it's necessary. </p>\n<p>Note that you must inform the DM if you take any Anti-Feats, especially any that require some discussion to work out the details.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are some Anti-Feats that negatively affect the entire party; if you decide to take such an Anti-Feat, you will also have to get permission from the rest of the party to make sure they're okay with dealing with whatever the penalties are. Such Anti-Feats are marked in parenthesis.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.yH8jiLv5nzcHKKyN]{Anemic}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.1Pvpn1t8jcRIimSD]{Bad Leg}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.sBIyUF7AS3eB7T5K]{Clumsy}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.mH0UaUUbMLEDjEsQ]{Cursed}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.Xp0ZkSI4LW9vbZIo]{Deaf}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.6mxizXrY3DB1HYyG]{Drug Addiction}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.PIjL9rJTxZK8SC2i]{Gambling Addict}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.BqvzTq4ZAH5GUWTq]{Glutton}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.royADvF8zdMDNZ3p]{Hated by Animals}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.hNAQ0I1cBv0LHOTh]{Hideous}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.5eLOFPY1rotCrOBY]{Honest (Party Permission)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.bGMLS93DBAfprq8I]{Hubris (Party Permission)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.htNrVEPxBA5bpKeo]{Illiterate}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.SlrO6jHnQuI9wAGe]{Insensitive}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.9xmdxx6AxnWUrDXQ]{Kleptomaniac (Party Permission)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.fluTTIIO3YRrxDqU]{Landlubber}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.hbZhX5J6ulhuLhX1]{Light Sensitivity}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.ZsKBLK1zV3Tc6Tcb]{Magic Aversion}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.HtKlJcVmO5TfBHIL]{Magic Susceptibility}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.3iNIlopHLfL3QnuL]{Narcoleptic}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.ZKjBHmZIhclXFqVU]{One-Armed}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.eNvViP8I6liaXWxg]{Pacifist (Party Permission)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.781XGzuxPPdaBhBN]{Paranoid}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.3VpdIrJ3ehhpBNzo]{Phobia}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.siUGYgAbtDsfDxa9]{Psychic Sensitivity}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.IwDko6giYm1AU0P5]{Senile}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.c4CfpX3ICIjyudwO]{Trusting (Party Permission)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.14z349fZaombMAq0]{Unlucky}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.9dLdRnLcpH1dOhcd]{Weak Immune System}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.V0xMPqOeTLTK4E49]{Weak Spot}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[raptor-rules.raptors-rules.XzLAjS2W0zKvyuAf]{Weak Willed}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-symbol-skull-tan.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"qR3nXVtyg6JqMR5j":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.tvmjuI0sPsfvjPe2"}}}

You may mix and match some aspects of your chosen race from different rulebooks as long as it is mostly balanced. Stronger races, such as Yuan-Tis and Aarakokras must come from the most recent rulebooks. The rule that allows you to choose any ability score increases is not in place, and you must use the default ability score increases that a race has from previous books. The only exception is if a race has no default ability score increases in any rulebooks.</p>\n<h3><strong>Point Buy</strong></h3>\n<p>All player characters will use point buy during character creation. Point buy will have three minor alterations to make it more flexible as follows:</p>\n<p>1. You have 29 points to spend instead of 27.</p>\n<p>2. You can decrease at most one ability score to a 6 or a 7 to gain 1 or 2 points that can be spent on other ability scores.</p>\n<p>3. You can increase at most one ability score to a 16 rather than 15, costing 2 points to go from 15 to 16.</p>\n<p>Since the charactermancer does not support custom point buy, you can use this <a style=\"background-color:#ffffff\" href=\"https://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html#aasimar&amp;NA&amp;8&amp;8&amp;8&amp;8&amp;8&amp;8&amp;0&amp;0&amp;29&amp;16&amp;6&amp;19&amp;15&amp;11&amp;9&amp;7&amp;5&amp;4&amp;3&amp;2&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;2&amp;4&amp;6&amp;9&amp;4&amp;4&amp;4&amp;4&amp;4&amp;4\">calculator</a>. It already has the custom rules setup.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'helvetica neue' , 'helvetica' , 'arial' , sans-serif\"><strong>Starting Feats</strong></h3>\n<p>Player characters that begin at level 7 or lower will receive one free feat at creation. Additionally, you can take an Anti-Feat to gain either an Ability Score Increase or an additional Feat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Rules:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">1. </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Multi-classing is not allowed without consulting the DM first. Multi-classing will generally not be allowed if you're just doing it to minmax. If you have a good character reason, for example a fighter becoming religious and multi-classing into cleric, then it will be much more likely to be allowed.</span></p>\n<div class=\"content note-editor notes\">\n<p><strong>2. </strong>Homebrew classes, subclasses, features, and backgrounds are allowed on a case by case basis. So long as it isn't overpowered and fits thematically, it will probably be allowed.</p>\n<p><strong>3. </strong>As the campaign goes on, players may choose to add additional information to their backstories based on what they learn about the setting. Make sure to inform the DM if you do this.</p>\n<p><strong>4. </strong>Exotic or homebrew races are generally allowed but you must consult the DM first.</p>\n<p><strong>5. </strong>Since it is unlikely for the campaign to proceed past level 13 or so, player characters may be allowed to gain access to certain class/subclass abilities earlier than they would normally. This will be on a case by case basis and will generally apply to abilities that aren't that powerful and more fun to play around with than anything else. Generally players will want to ask the DM about such abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>6. </strong>Evil characters are allowed but only after consulting the DM. For this campaign in particular they will be more acceptable than usual because the party is isolated from major civilizations and has the common goal of survival.</p>\n<p><strong>7. </strong>When initially creating your character, you may choose to have one Anti-Feat, which are feats with negative effects. If you do so, you may gain one Feat of your choice. You must consult the DM before picking an Anti-Feat and you can only have up to one Anti-Feat.</p>\n<p><strong>8. </strong>Increasing your Intelligence score can grant you additional skills and languages based on the following scores:<br />    11 - Proficiency in one additional language or tool<br />    13 - Proficiency in one additional language, tool, or skill<br />    15 - Proficiency in one additional language or tool<br />    17 - Proficiency in one additional language, tool, or skill<br />    19 - Proficiency in one additional language or tool</p>\n<p><strong>9. </strong>For this campaign in particular, clerics, paladins, and any other class that has easy access to radiant damage early on, are either not allowed or may be restricted, this is because radiant damage will play an important role for the campaign itself. Spells that do Radiant damage are fine so long as they require spell slots. This restriction will be lifted once the players reach a certain level.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"icons/vtt-512.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"qR3nXVtyg6JqMR5j":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.IIJzTfGStbu9TnB0"}}}
